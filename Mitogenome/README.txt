This folder contains the scripts used for mitogenome variant annotations in the associated publication https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evac090

Scripts were used as follows:
Wilcox-FalcoMitoConsensus(FalcoRef8).bash created a consensus mitogenome from archival falcon mitogenomes
Wilcox-FalcoMitoLR10XAlign(FalcoRef8).bash aligned falcon genomes to the falcon consensus mitogenome with longranger to create standardized mitogenome variant calls in VCF formats
