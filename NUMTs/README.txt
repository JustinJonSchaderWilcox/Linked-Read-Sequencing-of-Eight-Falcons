This folder contains the scripts used for NUMT annotations and analyses in the associated publication https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evac090

Scripts were used as follows:
Wilcox-FalconidaeMitoConsensus(FalcoRef8).bash built an hmmer profile of falconidae mitogenomes and uses this to find numts with nhmmer
Wilcox-DownloadAvianMitoGenomes(FalcoRef8).bash downloaded taxa-sampled avian mitogenomes for NUMT analysis
Wilcox-SyntenyNUMT(FalcoRef8).bash assessed synteny of NUMTs in falcons
Wilcox-ClusterNUMTs(FalcoRef8).bash clustered NUMTs with USEARCH for classification in phylogenetic analysis
Wilcox-NUMTsClustersRAxML(FalcoRef8).bash created NUMT phylogenies based on clusters
Wilcox-CompareNUMTsClusters(FalcoRef8).bash summarized and compared informaiton on NUMT clustering, synteny, and phylogenic relationships
